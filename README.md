# RAD-Components
Reusable, Accessible, Dynamic Components

RAD Components is a personal project maintained by me, Lily Williams.

It's purpose is to take dynamic and often quite complex web components and make them accessible to all users.
Solutions found here are based on a mixture of recommendations from WCAG 2.1 (A and AA) as well as experience of user testing with participants with a range of disabilties, specifically with a focus on screen reader user interactions.

RAD Components has been built with HTML5, CSS, WAI-ARIA and JQuery. Each has been tested with screen reader softwares including VoiceOver and / or NVDA.

Any questions or ideas feel free to get in touch :)
