# RAD-Components
Reusable, Accessible, Dynamic Components

RAD Components is a personal project maintained by me, Lily Williams.

It's purpose is to take dynamic and often quite complex web components and make them accessible to all users.
Solutions found here are based on a mixture of recommendation from success criterias found in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1</a> (A and AA) as well as experience of user testing with participants with a range of disabilties, specifically with a focus on screen reader user interactions.

RAD Components has been built with HTML5, CSS, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">WAI-ARIA</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com">JQuery</a>. Also with a little help from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery">Font Awesome</a> for icons and <a href="https://fonts.google.com">Google Fonts</a> for demo purposes.

Each has been thoroughly tested with screen reader softwares including Apple's built in Screen reader <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/mac/vision/">VoiceOver</a> and / or <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org">NVDA</a>.
